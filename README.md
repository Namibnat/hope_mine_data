# Hope Mine Records Namibia

Data was provided to me by a researcher
who had collected temperature and humidity
data in the Hope Mine, in central Namibia.

My goal here was to clean and prepare the
data in a way that it could be useful to compare
to future data.

The data was collected as part of a study of 
bats that use the mine.
